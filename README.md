# Setup instructions
These setup instructions will help you setup and run the Mercury Demo.

## Prerequisites
1. A valid sitecore license xml file
2. Windows 10 64 bit build 17763 or higher (press windows key, type in `run`, hit enter, type in `winver`, hit enter to check)
3. Ports 80, 443, 4200 and 5050 should be free. If another application uses these ports you will get a similar error to the one below:
```
ERROR: for sitecore  Cannot start service sitecore: failed to create endpoint mercurydemoweb_sitecore_1 on network nat: hnsCall failed in Win32: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (0x20)
```

## Setting up the demo environment
1. Put the `docker-compose.yml`, `license.xml` and `setup.ps1` in a folder of choice. These files are needed to start the environment so don't delete these.
2. Open up a powershell with admin rights, navigate to this folder (`cd <insertpath to folder here>`) and run `./setup.ps1 -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted`
     - Your computer may be asked restart multiple times.
3. Switch docker to `Windows Containers` by clicking on `Switch to Windows containers` in the menu that appears when you right click on `Docker Dekstop` in the `hidden icons` panel that can be located near your clock.

## Using the demo environment
1. Open up a powershell terminal and navigate to the folder where you put the `docker-compose.yml` 
2. Run `az login` to generate a login token and then `az acr login --name avivasolutionsnl` to gain access to our docker images. 
     - `az login` will open up a browser window where you can login. If you use the Edge browser it will hang at the login process. This step should work with the Chrome browser.
3. Run `docker-compose up`. The first time this can take a while as it has to download the environment, once downloaded you can skip step 2 the next time.
4. Now you can go to the following urls:
     - http://www.mercurydemo.localhost to view the site, 
     - http://www.mercurydemo.localhost/sitecore to view the cms 
     - https://commerce.mercurydemo.localhost:4200 to view commerce
5. You can stop the environment with `docker-compose down`

## Updating the demo environment (for when new versions of the demo are released)
1. Open a powershell and run `az acr login --name avivasolutionsnl`
2. Navigate to the folder with the `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose pull`. This can take a while.
